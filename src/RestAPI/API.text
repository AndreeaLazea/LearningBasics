Calling an API is just like accessing a web page.
When you enter a website => you make a request to it and the page that is
being shown to you is the actual response


Just like that, when you make a request to an api, you get a response back
that is either HTML( a web page) or plain text or JSON or XML or any other format.

When it comes to calling an api, you have a lot of choices as tools:
- Postman, the one I prefer.
- Insomnia
- Curl, comes installed by default for windows >= 10 and MacOS
